# How I worked on this project

### I worked on this project by programming it all in Android Studio. This was a project in my Mobile Application class where the assignment was to build an application that calls APIs for cat breeds (set with a limit of 10,000 total requests) using a Web Service as a source of data and has a User Interface (UI) created using Jetpack Standards. 

# How to navigate this project

### The project is divided into a few sections with each one having a sub-section. All the front-end programming is done inside the res folder, consisting of different components such as drawable, layout, mipmap, and values. All of the programming these folders is done in XML.
### The back-end is all inside the java folder, where they are all divided by fragments. Main class is one file, the code consisting of the drop-down fragment is a separate class file, and the information needed for textbinding is in another file.

# Why I built the project this way

### Building the project this way allowed me to implement best-coding practices where everything is easy to navigate and all the fragments are easily found based off their names and locations. 

# If I had more time I would change this

### I tried implementing this program a few different ways. Initially the way it was designed, I would click the refresh button and the program would load a new cat API request. But I had to change it to be the way you see it due to the assignment requrements asking for that specific output. However, if I were to change anything I would want to change the application to load random Cats on the click of a button instead of listing them all out since that sounds more exciting (atleast to me).
